1: Running program
    The command 'make' in src makes the a10 binary. It will be located in ./bin/a10
The command line argument is:
    $ /#PATH_TO_/bin/a10 DOCUMENT_LIST (FLAG[l,m, or h])

The FLAG changes the sensitivity (see below), and is optional. THe program will
default to 'm' if there is no flag.

The binaries can be cleaned from the ./bin/ and ./src/object using 'make clean'

The program will run by displaying every pair of documents that are being compared.

2:Testing
    Our testing suite comprises 2 main features. One is a set of unit tests that 
checks the major functions that return values in both DocumentCollection and 
NGramCollection. This checks all functions in DocumentCollection and
NgramCollection that return a value, or those that take in a value. Most of our
functions, however, mostly are output functions or are void return that modify
our private container classes. The unit tests therefore cannot really test these
functions that well.

    The other aspect of our testing are the automatic tests that are
